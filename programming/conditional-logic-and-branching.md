# Conditional Logic and Branching

## Question

What problem does Conditional Logic and Branching solve?

## Short Answer

Conditional statements evaluate boolean expressions to determine which branch of code to execute during program runtime. If the condition evaluates to true, the program executes the primary indented block; otherwise, it checks subsequent `elif` conditions or defaults to the `else` block. Branching logic enables software applications to adapt dynamically to varying user inputs and operational states.

## Simple Example

```python
if status_code == 200:
    print('Request succeeded')
elif status_code == 404:
    print('Resource not found')
else:
    print('Unexpected status')
```

## Key Point

Conditional branching directs program flow based on boolean expressions, handling alternate execution paths.
